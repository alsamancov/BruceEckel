Hey, mister! You got the time?
As a matter of fact, I do Cubbie!
Look at that!
It's exactly two seconds before I honk your nose and pull your underwear over your head.
Come on! Take him!
Step right up here! Don't be shy!
Nobody likes a bashful leather head.
Move it! For my first trick I would like to do something for you, son.
We have a giraffe.
There you go, son. Now get out of here, you bother me.
Now... Sorry, wrong pocket.
For you, son. A little body English.
A French poodle.
Sorry, son. The dog was rabid, had to put it down.
And last but not least, my favorite.
A Tommy gun.
