The ponies run, the girls are young,
The odd are there to beat.
You win a while and then it's done -
Your little winning streak.
And summoned now to deal with your invincible defeat
You live you life as if it's real
A thousand kisses deep.

I'm turning tricks, I'm getting fixed
I'm back on Boogie Street
You lose your grip, and then you slip
into the masterpiece
And maybe I had miles to drive
and promises to keep
you ditch it all to stay alive
a thousand kisses deep.
And sometimes when the night is slow,
The wretched and the meek
We gather up our hearts and go
a thousand kisses deep

Confined to sex we pressed against
the limits of the sea
I saw there were no oceans left for scavengers like me
I saw there were no oceans left for scavengers like me
I saw there were no oceans left for scavengers like me
I made it to the forward deck.
I made it to the forward deck.
I made it to the forward deck.
I made it to the forward deck.
I made it to the forward deck.
I made it to the forward deck.
I made it to the forward deck.
I made it to the forward deck.
I blessed our remnant fleet.
I blessed our remnant fleet.
I blessed our remnant fleet.
I blessed our remnant fleet.
I blessed our remnant fleet.
I blessed our remnant fleet.
I blessed out remnant fleet.
And then consented to be wrecked,
and then consented to be wrecked
and then consented to be wrecked
and then consented to be wrecked
and then consented to be wrecked
and then consented to be wrecked
